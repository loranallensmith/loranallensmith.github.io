I also make things.","body":"### A Shoney's Buffet Personified\r\nI'm what they call a [renaissance soul](http://www.renaissancesouls.com/). You might say it means I know just enough about everything to be a very dangerous man -- and you might be right. It also means I learn quickly, I'm undeterred in the face of mistakes, and I am at my best when I'm tasked with getting something done and moving on. \r\n\r\n### Writer\r\nA classically trained writer who holds an MFA in screenwriting from Boston University, I have written scripts for short films and features as well as commercial work. The pilot script for my television show *Pushing the Envelope* was nominated by Boston University for a Humanitas Prize fellowship. I am currently working on a book about screenwriting for industry outsiders.\r\n\r\n### Filmmaker\r\nAn award-winning filmmaker, I have produced and directed motion pictures for both independent and commercial productions. I have also done time in a camera house and worked for several years as a video editor and postproduction professional, creating motion graphics and tossing around cross dissolves like a chainsaw juggler on Venice Beach.\r\n\r\n### Teacher and Trainer\r\nIn addition to developing and teaching courses on screenwriting, filmmaking, and technology. I have also created system documentation and translated complex business workflows into digestible, human-friendly formats. An expert at workshopping and creative process facilitation, I have guided discussions about everything from Richard Gere's early work to complex federal grant requirements.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
