<p>I'm what they call a <a href="http://www.renaissancesouls.com/">renaissance soul</a>. You might say it means I know just enough about everything to be a very dangerous man -- and you might be right. It also means I learn quickly, I'm undeterred in the face of mistakes, and I am at my best when I'm tasked with getting something done and moving on. </p>

<a id="writer" class="anchor" href="#writer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writer</h3>

<p>A classically trained writer who holds an MFA in screenwriting from Boston University, I have written scripts for short films and features as well as commercial work. The pilot script for my television show <em>Pushing the Envelope</em> was nominated by Boston University for a Humanitas Prize fellowship. I am currently working on a book about screenwriting for industry outsiders.</p>

<a id="filmmaker" class="anchor" href="#filmmaker" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Filmmaker</h3>

<p>An award-winning filmmaker, I have produced and directed motion pictures for both independent and commercial productions. I have also done time in a camera house and worked for several years as a video editor and postproduction professional, creating motion graphics and tossing around cross dissolves like a chainsaw juggler on Venice Beach.</p>

<a id="teacher-and-trainer" class="anchor" href="#teacher-and-trainer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Teacher and Trainer</h3>

<p>In addition to developing and teaching courses on screenwriting, filmmaking, and technology. I have also created system documentation and translated complex business workflows into digestible, human-friendly formats. An expert at workshopping and creative process facilitation, I have guided discussions about everything from Richard Gere's early work to complex federal grant requirements.</p>
